<h1>Web scraper</h1>

<p>
Web scraper is a little program which sole purpose is to scrape data from websites that have information about apartments for rent in Belgrade and store all of that data in csv file or database. All possibilities will be thought out further so this program can be of some use to its users.  
</p>
<p>
    This project is in start up phase and it will be updated gradually part by part. 
</p>
<p>
    Programming language of choice for this project is Python and I use modules like Selenium (webdriver which allows me to get and scrape data) as well as Tkinter gui module so my program looks a bit fancier that naked TUI.
